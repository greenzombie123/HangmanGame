# Goal
The goal of this project is to create program that using asyncronous programming and an API. This app was made for the purpose of the Odin Project but instead of making a weather app, I wanted to make use of dictionary-like api, thus why I made a hangman game that pulls random words from an api called Random Word API created from API Ninjas (https://api-ninjas.com/).

# Features

Get a random word using an API
Guess the word using either the input or letter buttons
Renders a stick figure body

# Tools and Technologies
- Visual Studio Code
- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS
- Github and Git
- Web Pack
- ES Lint
- Linux Command Line
- Chrome Dev Tools
- Random Word API
- Web Animation API
- Canvas API

# Things I've Learned and Noticed
- Learned how to make asycronous code using `promises`, `await` and `async`.
- Learned how to use an API from another server. 
- Learned how to use the Web Animation and Canvas API
- Need to document my code.
- Need to commit more often and madk better comments on my commits.
- I have the tendency to rush into writing code right away and also not taking my time to read documentation slowly. Basically, need to slow down.
- This app will sometimes not work due to CORS policy. Need to learn more about this (and take my time to read the documents about it) and update this later.
