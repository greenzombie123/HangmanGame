Web Pack
ES Lint
Linux Command Line
Chrome Dev Tools
Random Word API
Web Animation API
Canvas API

# Things I've Learned and Noticed
Learned how to make asycronous code using `promises`, `await` and `async`.
Learned how to use an API from another server. 
Learned how to use the Web Animation and Canvas API
Need to document my code.
Need to commit more often and made better comments on my commits.
I have the tendency to rush into writing code rigth away and also not taking my time to read documentation slowly. Basically, need to slow down.
This app will sometimes not work due to CORS policy. Need to learn more about this (and take my time to read the documents about it).
